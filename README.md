ToDo:
>Use a queue of 2 blocks to show upcoming blocks, pull from the queue when adding to the game
>always print the queue on top of the game area, next block to the left
>when the game starts, read scores from a file and put them in a linked list

known bugs:
>termios doesnt reset after the game has ended
>reading from file creates and empty end node

Sample Game Area ():
{Current Score: 0 | Current Level: 1}
